About this Project
=========================

I originally created this app to generate contour graphs of change ringing rows, to make it easier to follow along when listening to and possibly attempting to judge ringing. Then I realized I had almost everything I needed to make a method and touch printer, so that became the primary feature.

The practice mode was inspired by [Robert Wallis's tutorials](https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/methods/tutorials) plus the discovery that the android app Methodology has a similar practice mode while Mobel does not.

This app uses the CCCBR's methods library in xml format, available [here](https://cccbr.github.io/methods-library/index.html).

I am very grateful for Nick Reilingh's help on this and other projects.
